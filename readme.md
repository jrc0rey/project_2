People love their city! If they didn't they wouldn't live there.
Our app gives people the opportunity to declare what they "f*ckin love" about their city 
in a loud and colorful fashion. 

Our app turns every input into a love statement. So even if it's negative it turns into a positive.
Ideally, we'd like to give the user the opportunity to add their own statemnts to a t-shirt.

---IMPROVEMENTS---

We would like to be able to add an option to delete(time issue), and a way to put a specific statement onto a t-shirt template to give the user an idea of what their t-shirt could look like. And the ability to post to other social media sites.

Initially we wanted each city to have their own separate color pallete to keep it unique, but we weren't sure how to do that when the user can input a new city each time. We might need to make it a set list in order for that idea to work. Or randomly generate colors.
